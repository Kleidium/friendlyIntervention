Ever wondered why powerful wizard companions couldn't transport themselves alongside you when you teleport? Or what about when you're an expert yourself, but seemingly powerless to transport a villager in need with you back to town? Or even better, you're an assassin with a mystical inclination. If only you could magically command your quarry to follow you and transport them to your killing room...

This mod allows companions to teleport with the player when using recall/intervention spells from any source, even player made spells and enchantments (as long as the teleport effect is the first effect of the spell/enchantment). A new Teleport Menu allows you to ask your companions to teleport the party instead.

## Teleport Menu: 

You can now ask NPC companions to teleport anyone in your party through the Teleport Menu. Simply talk to them and ask them about teleportation. If the NPC isn't skilled enough to teleport themselves or others, the teleport topic will not appear.

In the menu, choose any amount of party members to teleport. The total cost increases with each target proportional to the base teleport cost reduced by the companion's Mysticism skill. Enchantments and scrolls cannot be used in this menu, only the teleporter's magicka. Can be set not to require skill or magicka. Summoned creatures can be teleported for free if free summons are enabled.

Optionally, NPC companions can be allowed to have their own marks. Each companion has their own individual mark that cannot be accessed by anyone else, and cannot have more than one mark.


## Mysticism Skill Requirements

By default, the player needs 75 mysticism skill (modifiable) to transport others with them. The companion needs 50 mysticism skill (modifiable) to transport themselves, and 75 mysticism to transport others. Creatures are considered to have a skill of 0 unless they are daedra, so non-daedra creature companions need a player to transport them. If neither player nor companion have enough skill, a scroll can be used.

This skill check can be turned off to allow the player to transport companions without requiring skill. Also by default, summoned creatures transport with you for free.


## Magicka Requirements

By default, each companion transported requires 25 base magicka (modifiable) from the transporter, before being reduced by the transporter's mysticism skill. If a companion tries to transport themselves but is out of magicka, the player will cover the cost if the player meets their mysticism requirement. Only the player will spend their magicka if skill checks are turned off. If neither player nor companion have enough magicka, a scroll can be used.

This magicka requirement can be turned off to allow the player/companion to transport others/themselves for free. Also by default, summoned creatures transport with you for free.


## Enchantment Charges

Enchantment support is now here. You can now use additional enchantment casts to transport others before any skill or magicka is required. Once the item runs out of charges, regular skill and magicka checks come into play. Can be turned on/off.
